"Perfect Breakfast" by Amir Ashkan Nourkhalaj

when play begins: Say "It was 9A.M. and Tom was awake. He wasn't feeling like usual. Somehow, he was tired even though he had slept pretty well. His schedule was like before, his fiance as lovely as ever, and his boss as tolerable as ever. He didn't know what was wrong with him... He thinks... and thinks... and thinks... Finally! He remembers... His meals, in the last few weeks, were all processed foods. He decided he had enough… It was time to make some changes in his lifestyle. So, he decided, instead of the usual StarBucks breakfast, he will have a smoothie. He dashed out of his bed and went to kitchen.

He took off his phone and looked up the recipe of his favorite smoothie, 'Banana Strawberry Milkshake' with a touch of 'Cinnamon'.
