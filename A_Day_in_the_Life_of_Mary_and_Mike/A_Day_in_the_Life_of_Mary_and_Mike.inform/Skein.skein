Game Tutorial:
This Interactive Fiction game is a mixture of Galatea, and Façade.
The player can go east, west, north, or south only when they are outside Mary and Mike&apos;s house. Once in the house they player can ask Mike and Mary questions which follow these formats:

ask X about Y
ask Mike about job
ask Mary about...
etc...

The players can type &quot;hint&quot; at anytime to get a list of commands they can type to ask Mike, or Mary questions.
There are also options such as attack or defend, which the player can use to take Mike, or Mary&apos;s side in the argument.
Based on the player&apos;s choices the game will have multiple endings.

A Day in the Life of Mary and Mike
An Interactive Fiction by Amir Ashkan Nourkhalaj
Release 1 / Serial number 150608 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Scent of Jasmine mixed with citrus gives you relief. You get to the door. You hear the sound of argument coming from the other side of the door. Standing there, frozen and unsure of what to do.

&gt;[1] listen
To get a grasp of the situation, you close your ear to the door and listen carefully.
Woman: &quot;you know what Michael?! I think it&apos;s enough. I don&apos;t want to talk about it anymore and I&apos;m tired of acting like a fool. That&apos;s it for us.&quot;
The footsteps of the woman started rushing away from the living room.


&gt;[2] hint
knock, listen, look, south, north.

&gt;[3] knock
The argument stops and no more sound is coming from the house. As if no one has ever lived in this house. you better knock again.

&gt;[4] listen
You can only hear the sound of cars in the street.


&gt;[5] ring the bell
You hear someone approaching the door. Then a slightly irritated sound asks from behind the door: &quot;WHO IS IT?&quot; 
You: &quot;Your only adorable blind friend!&quot;
You hear the sound of door being opened and smiling voice welcoming you in. 

You get inside the house.

&gt;[6] ask mike about how he has been
You: &quot;So, how have you been?&quot;
Mike: &quot;I&apos;ve been great. Just going through tough times these past few days.&quot;

&gt;[7] ask mike about mary
You: &quot; adfs&quot;
Mike: &quot;Test Wife.&quot;

&gt;[8] hint
Ask Mike about: house, day, how he has been, life, weather, wife, mary, work, city, argument.

&gt;[9] ask mike about house
You: &quot;How do you like the house?&quot;
Mike: &quot;Ah, it&apos;s your first time here. It&apos;s not bad. Mary loves the garden. She spends most of her free time there. The house itself is pretty small, the kitchen is cozy and the living room is only a fancified corridor. No complains for the bedroom though. It&apos;s big enough for us to live in it happily.&quot; 
You sense a hint of irony in Mike&apos;s voice.

&gt;[10] ask mike about mom
Mike: &quot;I have to think about it.&quot;

&gt;[11] ask mike about the city
You: &quot;How do you like the city?&quot;
Mike: &quot;It&apos;s very quiet. It only has three movie theaters of which, one is always being repaired and the other has chairs with nails sticking out of them. There is a wonderful grocery shop in 4 min walking distance from us. Most of what it offers, which isn&apos;t that many, are locally grown. If you drive south you&apos;ll get to the ocean. There are multiple small nurseries down the road too. We bought a orange tree from it half a year ago. Mary planted it in the garden. Every morning she checks on it for any sign of fruits. Keep it a secret but I think she actually named the tree.&quot;

&gt;[12] ask mike about child
Mike: &quot;I rather not talk about it right now.&quot;

&gt;[13] ask mike about flower
Mike: &quot;Now is not a good time.&quot;

&gt;[14] ask mike about sex
Mike: &quot;I rather not talk about it right now.&quot;

&gt;[15] ask mike about city
Mike: &quot;I don&apos;t think the city has changed since we last talked about it.&quot;

&gt;[16] ask mike about what happened
Mike: &quot;What are you talking about&quot;
&gt;[17] ask mike about his car
Mike: &quot;I&apos;m not in the mood to talk about it.&quot;

&gt;[18] ask mike about argument
You: &quot;Is everything ok between you guys?&quot;
Mike: &quot;Oh! So, we were that loud? It&apos;s nothing serious… The usual hiccups in any relationships.&quot;
You hear footsteps entering the room. Mary starts speaking.
Mary: &quot;What do you mean it&apos;s not serious Michael?! How could it get any more serious?&quot;
You: &quot;It sure sounds more than a hiccup body&quot; 
Mary: &quot;Why don&apos;t you tell your friend what you&apos;ve done and let he be the judge...&quot; 
You: &quot;Nice, I get to be the marriage counselor!&quot; 
You can sense the weight of Mary&apos;s look on you. 
Mary: &quot;Can you stop being a wise ass for a second!&quot; 
You: &quot;sorry!&quot;

&gt;[19] hint
Ask Mike about: house, day, how he has been, life, weather, wife, mary, work, city, argument, what happened.

&gt;[4] ask mike about what happened
You: &quot;What happened?&quot;
Mike: &quot;Nothing! Really! I don&apos;t know what caused her to act like this. She kept asking me whether I have anything to say to her or not. I&apos;m as confused as you.&quot;
Mary: &quot;It started couple of months ago. Mike was coming home late once a week. After a while I realized there is a pattern to it. Every Thursday he would be couple of hours late. Also, every other weekends, he would make up an excuse and would go out for half a day. What&apos;s worst is, on Thursdays he always smells of one particular perfume. It never changes. On weekends, the perfumes are mix and hard to distinguish.&quot;
Mike: &quot;Why were you smelling my clothes?!&quot;

&gt;[5] defend mike
You: &quot;Mary, I&apos;m not sure that proves anything. It could be the perfume of a coworker who happens to share elevator with Mike on Thursdays and it only happens on Thursdays because for whatever reason, Mike leaves work later on that day.&quot; 
Mary: &quot;of course you would side with him. You are his college friend after all.&quot;

Mary leaves her chair and walks to her room. Then immediately comes back while carrying something with herself. She puts a package in front of you.

&gt;[6] take package
Taken.

&gt;[7] open package
You open package, revealing papers.

&gt;[8] take papers
You open the package and take out the papers inside it.

Taken.

&gt;[9] x papers
There are multiple glossy papers as big as your palm.

&gt;[10] ask mary about the papers
You: &quot;Mary, what are these papers?&quot;
Mary: &quot;Sorry, I forgot about your condition. These are pictures of Mike being intimate with different ladies.&quot;

&gt;[11] defend mary
You: &quot;Mike, can you explain the content of these photos?&quot;
Mike: &quot;These photos show me dancing with other people. I don&apos;t know why Mary is getting so worked up about these. Also, I&apos;m curious to know how she got these?&quot;
Mary: &quot;Can you stop treating me like a fool Mike? And for God&apos;s sake stop acting so matter-of-factly about it. It&apos;s hurting me seeing how indifferent you&apos;ve become. The photos are coming from a reliable source. An investigator who was hired by me when I first noticed your abnormal behavior.&quot;

&gt;[12] defend mike
You: &quot;Mary, instead of having someone spy on Mike, shouldn&apos;t you have talked to him first? Doesn&apos;t he have the right to know before anyone else?&quot;
Mary: &quot;Well I do have the right to know before anyone else too. If for any reason, Mike is bored of our relationship, shouldn&apos;t I be the first one that he talks to?&quot;
Mike: &quot;Wow, what&apos;s going on here! Can you guys stop talking like I&apos;m not here? And Mary, you do have a vivid and scary imaginations. Didn&apos;t that friend of yours, Mr. detective, mention anything else other than the photos?&quot;
Mary: &quot;No, he only sent me the photos and ask me whether I want him to continue the investigation or not. He didn&apos;t find any other evidence of anything else.
Mike: &quot;Well because there is nothing to be found Mary! Let me confess what has been going on. I&apos;ve been taking dance classes.&quot;

&gt;[13] defend mary
You: &quot;Well I guess Mary&apos;s friend wasn&apos;t too far off with those photos. So, Mr. Baryshnikov, why so secret? I don&apos;t think Mary would be as bothered by it as she is now if she knew what was going on&quot;
Mike: &quot;Because I didn&apos;t want her to find out&quot;
Mary: &quot;Why not Mike?&quot;
Mike: &quot;Because of you Mary. It supposed to be a surprise for you. The picture I had in mind was slightly different than what is happening now. I imagined everyone in a party are talking and having fun. Suddenly, the dance floor becomes empty and The Blue Danube starts. I&apos;ll walk toward you, elegantly. Stop in front of you, bowing graciously and offering my right hand. Your face will be a mixture of shock and embarrassment, but you accept my hand and dance with me. Our parents, friends, and Ms. Arlene, the lady who the Thursdays&quot; perfume belongs to, nodding their heads in acknowledgment.&quot;
Mary: &quot;Oh, Mike. I&apos;m so sorry for ruining your surprise.&quot;
Mike: &quot;It&apos;s alright. I&apos;m sure it wouldn&apos;t go that smoothly anyways.&quot;
Mary: &quot;I&apos;ll tell you what, we are going to rehearse the dance many times before that night and I promise to act as surprised and embarrassed as I can.&quot;
Mike: &quot;That&apos;s so sweet of you&quot;


    *** You: &quot;Wow, what a day it was. Guys, I&apos;m really relieved that everything was a misunderstanding. You know both of you are dear friends of mine and nothing is more heartwrenching to me than seeing you both at each other&apos;s throat. I understand sometimes it&apos;s too hard to talk, sometimes you feel the space between you two is infinite and your voice is not reaching the other person. But you&apos;ve got to get your act together if you want to survive. I don&apos;t think it was the first time that such a conflict occurs and let me promise you something, out of experience, it won&apos;t be the last time either. The only cure for this disease, the only ointment for such injuries is talking. So, promise me to talk to each other when something is bothering you.&quot;
Mary: &quot;Sure.&quot;
Mike: &quot;I hope you don&apos;t find it too insensitive of me, but since you lost your eyesight, it feels like you&apos;ve become a philosopher!&quot;
You: &quot;Mike, I was always a secret philosopher at heart.&quot; ***

&gt;[1] knock
The argument stops and no more sound is coming from the house. As if no one has ever lived in this house. you better knock again.

&gt;[2] knock
You hear someone approaching the door. Then a slightly irritated sound asks from behind the door: &quot;WHO IS IT?&quot; 
You: &quot;Your only adorable blind friend!&quot;
You hear the sound of door being opened and smiling voice welcoming you in. 

You get inside the house.

&gt;[3] ask mike about the argument
You: &quot;Is everything ok between you guys?&quot;
Mike: &quot;Oh! So, we were that loud? It&apos;s nothing serious… The usual hiccups in any relationships.&quot;
You hear footsteps entering the room. Mary starts speaking.
Mary: &quot;What do you mean it&apos;s not serious Michael?! How could it get any more serious?&quot;
You: &quot;It sure sounds more than a hiccup body&quot; 
Mary: &quot;Why don&apos;t you tell your friend what you&apos;ve done and let he be the judge...&quot; 
You: &quot;Nice, I get to be the marriage counselor!&quot; 
You can sense the weight of Mary&apos;s look on you. 
Mary: &quot;Can you stop being a wise ass for a second!&quot; 
You: &quot;sorry!&quot;

&gt;[4] ask mike about what happened
You: &quot;What happened?&quot;
Mike: &quot;Nothing! Really! I don&apos;t know what caused her to act like this. She kept asking me whether I have anything to say to her or not. I&apos;m as confused as you.&quot;
Mary: &quot;It started couple of months ago. Mike was coming home late once a week. After a while I realized there is a pattern to it. Every Thursday he would be couple of hours late. Also, every other weekends, he would make up an excuse and would go out for half a day. What&apos;s worst is, on Thursdays he always smells of one particular perfume. It never changes. On weekends, the perfumes are mix and hard to distinguish.&quot;
Mike: &quot;Why were you smelling my clothes?!&quot;

&gt;[5] attack mike
You: &quot;I was prepared to defend you no matter what she threw at me. But, I don&apos;t really know what to say to this Mike. Care to give us some explanations?&quot; 
Mike: &quot;Mary, I&apos;m telling you it&apos;s not what you think. I don&apos;t even know where you got these weird ideas. I don&apos;t want to hear it anymore.&quot; 
Mike stands up. The living room is painfully silent. Mary is holding her tears. She looks at you.
Mary: &quot;let me show you something.&quot;

Mary leaves her chair and walks to her room. Then immediately comes back while carrying something with herself. She puts a package in front of you.

&gt;[6] take package
Taken.

&gt;[7] open package
You open package, revealing papers.

&gt;[8] take papers
You open the package and take out the papers inside it.

Taken.

&gt;[9] x papers
There are multiple glossy papers as big as your palm.

&gt;[10] ask mary about the papers
You: &quot;Mary, what are these papers?&quot;
Mary: &quot;Sorry, I forgot about your condition. These are pictures of Mike being intimate with different ladies.&quot;

&gt;[11] defend mary
You: &quot;Mike, can you explain the content of these photos?&quot;
Mike: &quot;These photos show me dancing with other people. I don&apos;t know why Mary is getting so worked up about these. Also, I&apos;m curious to know how she got these?&quot;
Mary: &quot;Can you stop treating me like a fool Mike? And for God&apos;s sake stop acting so matter-of-factly about it. It&apos;s hurting me seeing how indifferent you&apos;ve become. The photos are coming from a reliable source. An investigator who was hired by me when I first noticed your abnormal behavior.&quot;

&gt;[12] attack mike
You: &quot;First perfumes and now these photos. In my eyes, you were always the faithful type Mike. I wouldn&apos;t believe such a thing even I would have seen it with my own two eyes. Why?&quot;
Mary: &quot;Yes Mike, I&apos;d like to know WHY too.&quot;
Mike: &quot;I&apos;m not appreciating how you guys are treating me right now. As if I&apos;m a convicted criminal.&quot;
Mary: &quot;If we are treating you that way, is because you are acting like one Mike. What is the reason behind all these secretive behaviors?&quot;
Mike: &quot;Fine, jeez. Let me explain then. Yes, I am in those photos and I&apos;ve been dancing with other ladies. But it&apos;s all because I&apos;ve been taking a dance classes.&quot;

&gt;[13] defend mary
You: &quot;Well I guess Mary&apos;s friend wasn&apos;t too far off with those photos. So, Mr. Baryshnikov, why so secret? I don&apos;t think Mary would be as bothered by it as she is now if she knew what was going on&quot;
Mike: &quot;Because I didn&apos;t want her to find out&quot;
Mary: &quot;Why not Mike?&quot;
Mike: &quot;Because of you Mary. It supposed to be a surprise for you. The picture I had in mind was slightly different than what is happening now. I imagined everyone in a party are talking and having fun. Suddenly, the dance floor becomes empty and The Blue Danube starts. I&apos;ll walk toward you, elegantly. Stop in front of you, bowing graciously and offering my right hand. Your face will be a mixture of shock and embarrassment, but you accept my hand and dance with me. Our parents, friends, and Ms. Arlene, the lady who the Thursdays&quot; perfume belongs to, nodding their heads in acknowledgment.&quot;
Mary: &quot;Oh, Mike. I&apos;m so sorry for ruining your surprise.&quot;
Mike: &quot;It&apos;s alright. I&apos;m sure it wouldn&apos;t go that smoothly anyways.&quot;
Mary: &quot;I&apos;ll tell you what, we are going to rehearse the dance many times before that night and I promise to act as surprised and embarrassed as I can.&quot;
Mike: &quot;That&apos;s so sweet of you&quot;


    *** 

You: &quot;So, Mr. Romantic, do you try to surprise your wife often?&quot;
Mike: &quot;No, it was the first time. I thought our anniversary should be something special.&quot;
You: &quot;It sure was. Don&apos;t worry, you need a lot of practice though. And please don&apos;t act so suspicious next time when you are planning a surprise. Perfume on your clothes, patterned schedule changes, leaving the house on any day other than workdays, they are all red flags.&quot;
Mary: &quot;Wait a minute, are you teaching him how to deceive me?&quot;
You: &quot;No, Mary, I&apos;m not. I&apos;m teaching him how to surprise you. How he wants to use that knowledge is totally up to him.&quot;

&gt;[1] listen
To get a grasp of the situation, you close your ear to the door and listen carefully.
Woman: &quot;you know what Michael?! I think it&apos;s enough. I don&apos;t want to talk about it anymore and I&apos;m tired of acting like a fool. That&apos;s it for us.&quot;
The footsteps of the woman started rushing away from the living room.


&gt;[2] hint
knock, listen, look, south, north.

&gt;[3] knock
The argument stops and no more sound is coming from the house. As if no one has ever lived in this house. you better knock again.

&gt;[4] listen
You can only hear the sound of cars in the street.


&gt;[5] ring the bell
You hear someone approaching the door. Then a slightly irritated sound asks from behind the door: &quot;WHO IS IT?&quot; 
You: &quot;Your only adorable blind friend!&quot;
You hear the sound of door being opened and smiling voice welcoming you in. 

You get inside the house.

&gt;[6] ask mike about how he has been
You: &quot;So, how have you been?&quot;
Mike: &quot;I&apos;ve been great. Away from friends and my parents but I ain&apos;t complaining.&quot;

&gt;[7] ask mike about mary
You: &quot; How&apos;s Mary?&quot;
Mike: &quot;Oh, Mary is good. She&apos;s here too. She is in her room, taking care of some stuff. She should be done soon. She&apos;ll be happy to know that you are here.&quot;

&gt;[8] hint
Ask Mike about: house, day, how he has been, life, weather, wife, mary, work, city, argument, etc.

&gt;[9] ask mike about house
You: &quot;How do you like the house?&quot;
Mike: &quot;Ah, it&apos;s your first time here. It&apos;s not bad. Mary loves the garden. She spends most of her free time there. The house itself is pretty small, the kitchen is cozy and the living room is only a fancified corridor. No complains for the bedroom though. It&apos;s big enough for us to live in it happily.&quot; 
You sense a hint of irony in Mike&apos;s voice.

&gt;[10] ask mike about mom
Mike: &quot;We&apos;ll talk about it later.&quot;

&gt;[11] ask mike about the city
You: &quot;How do you like the city?&quot;
Mike: &quot;It&apos;s very quiet. It only has three movie theaters of which, one is always being repaired and the other has chairs with nails sticking out of them. There is a wonderful grocery shop in 4 min walking distance from us. Most of what it offers, which isn&apos;t that many, are locally grown. If you drive south you&apos;ll get to the ocean. There are multiple small nurseries down the road too. We bought a orange tree from it half a year ago. Mary planted it in the garden. Every morning she checks on it for any sign of fruits. Keep it a secret but I think she actually named the tree.&quot;

&gt;[12] ask mike about child
Mike: &quot;I always wanted children. I&apos;m not sure when... We have to be ready for it.&quot;

&gt;[13] ask mike about flower
Mike: &quot;Mary is really into flowers. In my mind they are pretty, sure... But a lot of work has to go into taking care of them&quot;

&gt;[14] ask mike about sex
Mike: &quot;Yep, here comes the famous vulgarity. I know we&apos;ve been friends for a long time, but, come on!&quot;

&gt;[15] ask mike about city
Mike: &quot;I don&apos;t think the city has changed since we last talked about it.&quot;

&gt;[16] ask mary about what happened
You can&apos;t see any such thing.

&gt;[17] ask mike about his car
Mike: &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;

&gt;[18] ask mike about argument
You: &quot;Is everything ok between you guys?&quot;
Mike: &quot;Oh! So, we were that loud? It&apos;s nothing serious… The usual hiccups in any relationships.&quot;
You hear footsteps entering the room. Mary starts speaking.
Mary: &quot;What do you mean it&apos;s not serious Michael?! How could it get any more serious?&quot;
You: &quot;It sure sounds more than a hiccup body&quot; 
Mary: &quot;Why don&apos;t you tell your friend what you&apos;ve done and let he be the judge...&quot; 
You: &quot;Nice, I get to be the marriage counselor!&quot; 
You can sense the weight of Mary&apos;s look on you. 
Mary: &quot;Can you stop being a wise ass for a second!&quot; 
You: &quot;sorry!&quot;

&gt;[19] hint
Ask Mike about: house, day, how he has been, life, weather, wife, mary, work, city, argument, what happened, etc.
Ask Mary about: what happened.

&gt;[20] ask mike about what happened
You: &quot;What happened?&quot;
Mike: &quot;Nothing! Really! I don&apos;t know what caused her to act like this. She kept asking me whether I have anything to say to her or not. I&apos;m as confused as you.&quot;
Mary: &quot;It started couple of months ago. Mike was coming home late once a week. After a while I realized there is a pattern to it. Every Thursday he would be couple of hours late.

On weekends, the perfumes are mix and hard to distinguish.&quot;
Mike: &quot;Why were you smelling my clothes?!&quot;

&gt;[21] hint
You can attack or defend either Mike or Mary.

&gt;[22] defend mike
You: &quot;Mary, I&apos;m not sure that proves anything. It could be the perfume of a coworker who happens to share elevator with Mike on Thursdays and it only happens on Thursdays because for whatever reason, Mike leaves work later on that day.&quot; 
Mary: &quot;of course you would side with him. You are his college friend after all.&quot;

Mary leaves her chair and walks to her room. Then immediately comes back while carrying something with herself. She puts a package in front of you.

&gt;[23] ask mary about house
Mary: &quot;We&apos;ll talk about it later.&quot;

&gt;[24] take package
Taken.

&gt;[25] ask mary about the package
Mary: &quot;Open it. You&apos;ll see.&quot;

&gt;[27] open package
You open package, revealing papers.

&gt;[28] take papers
You take out the papers inside the package.

Taken.

&gt;[29] x papers

&gt;[32] defend mary
You: &quot;Mike, she has every right to be concern.&quot;&quot;
Mike: &quot;But to go as far as hiring someone to follow me? Why couldn&apos;t she asked me directly?&quot;
Mary: &quot;I&apos;m sorry… But… But I was afraid.&quot;
Mike: &quot;AFRAID?! Of me?&quot;&quot;
Mary: &quot;No, Mike. Not of you. Of what I might have heard… Or worse, what you might not have told me.&quot;&quot;
Mike: &quot;I&apos;m sorry Mary.&quot;

&gt;[33] defend mike
You: &quot;I knew it. The Mr. Meek Mike and adultery!&quot;
Mike: &quot;You shut up!&quot;
You: &quot;But why hide it?&quot;
Mike: &quot;Well, it was supposed to be a surprise.&quot;
You: &quot;Well it sure was.&quot;
Mary: &quot;What do you mean, SURPRISE?!&quot;
Mike: &quot;For our anniversary. I&apos;ve planned a small party. I talked to your dad and he told me that you like Waltz, Tango and Salsa. Every Thursday, I was practicing Waltz and Tango. The perfume that you smelled was from my instructor. Every other weekend, there is a social club gathering in town. I&apos;ve been participating and practicing Salsa. I don&apos;t have a fixed partner and I&apos;m practicing with whoever&apos;s available; hence the mixed perfumes.&quot;
Mary: &quot;Oh, Mike. I am so sorry. I&apos;m so stupid. What have I been thinking?!&quot;
Mike: &quot;Let me help you Mary. You WEREN&apos;T THINKING at all!&quot;
Mike finished his sentence with a reassuring smile.



    *** 

You: &quot;Wow, what a day it was. Guys, I&apos;m really relieved that everything was a misunderstanding. You know both of you are dear friends of mine and nothing is more heartwrenching to me than seeing you both at each other&apos;s throat. I understand sometimes it&apos;s too hard to talk, sometimes you feel the space between you two is infinite and your voice is not reaching the other person. But you&apos;ve got to get your act together if you want to survive. I don&apos;t think it was the first time that such a conflict occurs and let me promise you something, out of experience, it won&apos;t be the last time either. The only cure for this disease, and the only ointment for such injuries is talking. So, promise me to talk to each other when something is bothering you.&quot;
Mary: &quot;Sure.&quot;
Mike: &quot;I hope you don&apos;t find it too insensitive of me, but since you lost your eyesight, it feels like you&apos;ve become a philosopher!&quot;
You: &quot;Mike, I was always a secret philosopher at heart.&quot;
